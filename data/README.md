## Testing Data

### Single Chain

`single_chain.pdb` is PDB entry 5XH3 - Crystal structure of PET hydrolase R103G/S131A - which is a single chain pdb file
`single_chain_w_del.pdb` is the same but has residues 40, 41, 42, and 43 deleted.

### Multi Chain

`multi_chain.pdb` is PDB entry 8BEE - Cryo-EM structure of A. Thaliana I+III2 supercomplex - which is a large multi-chain structure (B, C, D, I, P, U, V, W, Z, and q chains)
`multi_chain_w_del.pdb` - Same - deletion of B chain residues 207, 208, 209, 210, and 211.

I will need to check what the correct interacting sections actually are for these, but
for simple testing that stuff doesn't blow up, this is fine.
